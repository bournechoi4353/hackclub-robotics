// monte carlo localization (particle filter), v1.
//
// the one rule, do not weaken it: IMU owns heading, MCL owns position. a
// clean wall hit may raise an alarm about heading but never silently change
// it. the field is 4-fold symmetric, so a range-only filter literally can't
// tell the four 90-degree rotations apart, heading HAS to come from the
// IMU. that's enforced structurally: particles are (x, y) only and all share
// the live IMU heading, so there's no heading state to corrupt. corrections
// only ever call odom_x_set/odom_y_set, never theta.
//
// what to expect: this is an automatic wall reset, not continuous
// cm-accurate tracking. with all the cups/pins/robots out there most beams
// hit moving junk, it corrects when it gets clean wall readings and coasts
// on odom the rest of the time. don't tune it toward continuous tracking,
// that destabilizes it.
//
// corrections queue up and only flush when the robot is settled, between
// motions. a pose jump mid-drive re-aims pure pursuit and spikes the PID,
// and the lurch is worse than the drift. x and y gate independently, since near
// one wall only one axis is observable.
//
// usage in an auton:
//   chassis.odom_xyt_set(START_X, START_Y, START_THETA);  // field coords!
//   mcl::start(START_X, START_Y);
//   ... normal EZ motions ...
//   chassis.pid_wait();
//   mcl::flush_if_safe();
// auto-flush (on by default) also fires whenever the robot sits still for a
// bit, so the explicit calls are optional.
